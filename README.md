# SCSS Concepts 

**Preprocessing** - The SCSS files are preprocessed into CSS to make the styling more maintainable and efficient.

**Variables** - Variables are used to store colors, font stacks, and other values for reuse throughout the stylesheets.

**Nesting** - Nesting is used to reflect the HTML structure, making the SCSS more readable and easier to maintain.

**Partials** - Partials are used to split the SCSS code into smaller, manageable files.

**Modules** - The project uses modular SCSS files to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

**Mixins** - Mixins are used to avoid repetition and keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

**Inheritance** - Inheritance is used to share common styles between different selectors.
